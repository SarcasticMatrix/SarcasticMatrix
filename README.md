# 👋 Welcome!
Being French (cocorico 🐓), I naturally have a strong love for math ! (especially stochastic calculus) I had the chance to train in energy markets at Centrica Energy and DTU in Denmark, getting the best of both worlds in energy markets, quantitative modeling and ML :)

## 🛠️ Projects  
Currently, I am developing **hestonpy**, a Python library for:  
- Pricing options  
- Hedging strategies  
- Calibration of models (delta of course but also delta-vega)

📌 Supports Heston and Black-Scholes models. Check it out [here](https://github.com/SarcasticMatrix/hestonpy)!

## 📚 Main References  
Here are some of the books that guide my research and development:  
- *Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time* – T. Björk  
- *The Volatility Surface* – J. Gatheral  
- *Electricity Derivatives* – R. Aïd  
- *Quantitative Portfolio Management* – M. Isichenko

## Interests

- Option Theory
  - Pricing 
  - Hedging & Risk Management  
  - Model Calibration

💬 Let's talk quant, energy, and trading!
