# 👋 Welcome!
Being French (cocorico :chicken:), I naturally have a strong love for math ! (especially stochastic calculus) 

I had the chance to train in energy markets at Centrica Energy and DTU in Denmark, getting the best of both worlds in energy markets, quantitative modeling and ML :)

I did a double degree in Engineering and Quantitative Finance at Télécom SudParis and Paris Dauphine University.

## 🛠️ Projects  
> [!NOTE]
> Currently, I am developing `hestonpy`, a Python library for:  
> - Options pricing
> - Hedging strategies (delta of course but also delta-vega)
> - Calibration of models 
> - Portfolio managment and Stochastic Control
>   
> 📌 Supports Heston and Black-Scholes models. Check it out [here](https://github.com/SarcasticMatrix/hestonpy)!
