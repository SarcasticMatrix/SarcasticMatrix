# 👋 Welcome!
Being French (cocorico 🐓), I naturally have a strong love for math ! (especially stochastic calculus) I had the chance to train in energy markets at Centrica Energy and DTU in Denmark, getting the best of both worlds in energy markets, quantitative modeling and ML :)

Quantitative Research & Machine Learning in Energy Trading:
- Energy Commodities (Power, Natural Gas, Oil), FX, Fixed Income  
- Option Theory & Pricing  
- Hedging & Risk Management  
- Model Calibration  
- Systematic Trading Strategies  

## 📚 Main References  
Here are some of the books that guide my research and development:  
- *Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time* – T. Björk  
- *The Volatility Surface* – J. Gatheral  
- *Electricity Derivatives* – R. Aïd  
- *Quantitative Portfolio Management* – M. Isichenko  
- *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives* – J. Hull  

## 🛠️ Projects  
Currently, I am developing **hestonpy**, a Python library for:  
✅ Pricing options  
✅ Hedging strategies  
📌 Calibration of models (delta of course but also delta-vega)

Supports Heston and Black-Scholes models. More features coming soon!

💬 Let's talk quant, energy, and trading!
