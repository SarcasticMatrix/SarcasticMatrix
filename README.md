# Hello, World!

I'm Théophile from Paris. Currently, I am developing `hestonpy`, a Python library for:  
- Options pricing
- Hedging strategies (delta of course but also delta-vega)
- Calibration of models

Supports Heston and Bates models: check it out [here](https://sarcasticmatrix.github.io/hestonpy/)!
